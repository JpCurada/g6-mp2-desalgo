I. Assigned Algorithm

        A. Name of Algorithm:
        0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming + Backtracking)

B. Pseudocode:

            1. Manually count number_of_items from items list.

            2. Create a 2D table knapsack_table with size (number_of_items + 1) × (capacity + 1)
            and initialize all cells to 0.

            3. Fill the table:
            For each item_index from 1 to number_of_items:
                For each current_capacity from 0 to capacity:
                    If current item fits:
                        Calculate value with item
                        Calculate value without item
                        Store the maximum of the two
                    Else:
                        Copy value from previous item

            4. Recursively backtrack from bottom-right cell:
            If item was included in the optimal value:
                Add to current subset
                Recurse with reduced capacity
            Also recurse without including the item

            5. Collect all valid optimal subsets
            
            6. Return:
            - first valid optimal subset
            - highest total value
            - list of all optimal subsets



C. Brief Description:

        The 0/1 Knapsack algorithm is used to select the most valuable subset of items that fit within a given weight capacity. 
        This implementation uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum achievable value and backtracking to list all item combinations that achieve it.

    III. Simulation / Step-by-Step Example

    A. Sample Input:

    items = [(10, 5), (40, 4), (30, 6)] 

    capacity = 10

  B. Step-by-Step Process:

    Item count: 3

    Knapsack capacity: 10

    DP Table size: 4 rows × 11 columns (for 0–3 items, capacity 0–10)

    Filling DP Table:

            Item 1 (weight: 10, value: 5):

            Fits at capacity = 10

            → dp[1][10] = 5

            Item 2 (weight: 40, value: 4):

            Too heavy for all capacities (weight > 10)

            → Table unchanged for this item

            Item 3 (weight: 30, value: 6):

            Also too heavy for all capacities


            C. Backtracking Step:

                    Start from dp[3][10] = 5

                    Compare with dp[2][10] = 5 → no item included

                    Compare with dp[1][10] = 5 → possible inclusion of Item 1

                    Item 1 (value: 5, weight: 10) fits → included

                    Backtrack to dp[0][0]


                    D. Final Output:

                        Best subset: [0] → corresponds to Item 1

                        Best value: 5

                        All valid subsets: [[0]] (only one subset achieves max value)



        IV. Discussion

        A. Implementation Logic:

        The logic follows a clear DP table-based strategy for tracking max values at each weight capacity. 
        The use of manual loops, recursive backtracking, and custom data structures fits the constraint of avoiding built-ins and imports, while still producing all optimal subsets.

        C. Possible Improvements / Future Work:

        - Optimize space by using a 1D table if only best value is needed

        - Improve efficiency in subset backtracking (avoid duplicates)

        - Pre-sort items by value-to-weight ratio to prioritize high-efficiency items in dynamic approximation.
